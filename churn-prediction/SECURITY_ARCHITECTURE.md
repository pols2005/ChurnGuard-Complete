## Security Architecture Overview

### Threat Model
ChurnGuard operates under a **Zero Trust Security Model** with the following threat assumptions:
- External attackers attempting to breach customer data
- Malicious insiders with legitimate access credentials  
- Accidental data exposure through misconfigurations
- Regulatory compliance violations (GDPR, CCPA, SOX)
- Cross-tenant data leakage in multi-tenant environment

### Security Principles
1. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security layers at network, application, and data levels
2. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Minimal access rights for all users and systems
3. **Data Minimization**: Collect and retain only necessary personal data
4. **Privacy by Design**: Privacy controls built into architecture from inception
5. **Continuous Monitoring**: Real-time threat detection and compliance monitoring

## Data Protection & Privacy

### Data Classification
| Classification | Description | Examples | Protection Level |
|---------------|-------------|----------|------------------|
| **Public** | Non-sensitive information | Marketing content, public documentation | Basic |
| **Internal** | Business information | Financial reports, business metrics | Standard |
| **Confidential** | Sensitive business data | Customer lists, prediction models | High |
| **Restricted** | Regulated personal data | PII, health data, payment info | Maximum |

### Personal Data Inventory (GDPR Article 30)
```json
{
  "data_processing_inventory": {
    "customer_profiles": {
      "legal_basis": "Contract (Article 6.1.b)",
      "purpose": "Service delivery and customer support",
      "categories": ["Contact details", "Company information"],
      "retention_period": "Contract duration + 7 years",
      "recipients": ["Internal teams", "Authorized processors"],
      "transfers": "None outside EU/EEA",
      "security_measures": ["Encryption", "Access controls", "Audit logging"]
    },
    "prediction_data": {
      "legal_basis": "Legitimate interest (Article 6.1.f)",
      "purpose": "Churn prediction analytics",
      "categories": ["Behavioral data", "Usage patterns", "Risk scores"],
      "retention_period": "3 years from last activity",
      "automated_processing": true,
      "profiling": "Churn risk scoring with human oversight"
    },
    "audit_logs": {
      "legal_basis": "Legal obligation (Article 6.1.c)",
      "purpose": "Security monitoring and compliance",
      "retention_period": "7 years minimum",
      "categories": ["Access logs", "System events", "Data changes"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Data Flow Security
```
Customer Data Entry → Input Validation → Business Logic → Database (RLS) 
                                    ↓
Audit Logging ← User Interface ← Authorization Check ← Data Retrieval
```

**Security Controls at Each Stage:**
1. **Data Entry**: Input validation, XSS prevention, CSRF protection
2. **Business Logic**: Authorization checks, rate limiting, data sanitization  
3. **Database**: RLS policies, encryption, access logging
4. **Data Retrieval**: Permission filtering, output sanitization, audit logging
5. **User Interface**: CSP headers, secure session management

---

## Multi-Tenant Security Model

### Tenant Isolation Architecture

#### Database-Level Isolation (Primary Defense)
```sql
-- Row-Level Security Implementation
CREATE POLICY tenant_isolation ON {table_name}
    USING (organization_id = current_setting('app.current_organization_id')::uuid);

-- Applied to all tenant-specific tables:
-- ✓ customers, users, dashboards, predictions, audit_logs, themes
-- ✓ data_subject_requests, retention_policies
```

**Security Properties:**
- **Complete Data Isolation**: No SQL query can access cross-tenant data
- **Automatic Enforcement**: Database engine enforces policies before returning results  
- **Performance Optimized**: Policies use indexed organization_id columns
- **Audit Trail**: All policy violations logged automatically

#### Application-Level Validation (Secondary Defense)
```python
def require_org_access(f):
    """Decorator ensuring user belongs to requested organization"""
    @wraps(f)
    def decorated_function(org_id, *args, **kwargs):
        if request.user.organization_id != org_id and not request.user.is_super_admin:
            audit_log_access_violation(request.user.id, org_id, 'unauthorized_access')
            raise SecurityException("Cross-tenant access denied")
        return f(org_id, *args, **kwargs)
    return decorated_function
```

#### Network-Level Isolation (Tertiary Defense)
- **Database Connection Pooling**: Separate connection pools per tenant
- **API Gateway**: Tenant routing and request validation
- **CDN Configuration**: Tenant-specific asset delivery

### Tenant Security Boundaries

#### Data Segregation Verification
```python
class TenantIsolationTest:
    def test_customer_data_isolation(self):
        """Verify customers from different orgs cannot access each other's data"""
        org1_user = create_test_user(org_id="org1")  
        org2_data = create_test_customer(org_id="org2")
        
        with pytest.raises(SecurityException):
            get_customer(org2_data.id, user=org1_user)
    
    def test_dashboard_isolation(self):
        """Verify dashboards are completely isolated between tenants"""
        # Implementation verifies RLS and application-level controls
```

#### Shared Resource Security
- **Application Code**: Shared, with tenant-specific execution contexts
- **Database Schema**: Shared structure, isolated data via RLS
- **File Storage**: Tenant-specific directories with access controls
- **Caching**: Tenant-prefixed cache keys to prevent data leakage

---

        """
        Authentication flow:
        1. Validate credentials against secure hash (bcrypt, 12+ rounds)
        2. Check account status (active, not locked, not expired)
        3. Validate organization membership
        4. Apply MFA requirements based on role
        5. Generate JWT with minimal required claims
        6. Log authentication event with security metadata
